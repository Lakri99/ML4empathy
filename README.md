## Multimodal Learning for Identifying Opportunities for Empathetic Responses

Embodied interactive agents possessing emotional intelligence and empathy can create natural and engaging social
interactions. Providing appropriate responses by interactive
virtual agents requires the ability to perceive users’ emotional states. In this paper, we study and analyze behavioral
cues that indicate an opportunity to provide an empathetic
response. Emotional tone in language in addition to facial
expressions are strong indicators of dramatic sentiment in
conversation that warrant an empathetic response. To automatically recognize such instances, we develop a multimodal deep neural network for identifying opportunities
when the agent should express positive or negative empathetic responses. We train and evaluate our model using
audio, video and language from human-agent interactions
in a wizard-of-Oz setting, using the wizard’s empathetic responses and annotations collected on Amazon Mechanical
Turk as ground-truth labels. Our model outperforms a textbased baseline achieving F1-score of 0.71 on a three-class
classification. We further investigate the results and evaluate
the capability of such a model to be deployed for real-world
human-agent interactions.
